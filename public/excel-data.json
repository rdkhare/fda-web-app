With longer term and higher dose use of senna, however, adverse events have been described including several cases of clinically apparent liver injury. The time to onset of liver injury was usually after 3 to 5 months of use, and the pattern of serum enzyme elevations was hepatocellular. The liver injury was usually mild-to-moderate in severity and resolved rapidly with discontinuation. In at least one instance, reexposure led to rapid recurrence of liver injury. Immunoallergic features and autoimmune markers were not present in the published cases. In addition, a related plant commonly known as coffee senna or Cassia orientalis has been linked to many instances of acute, severe toxicity with encephalopathy, myopathy and hepatic dysfunction. Outbreaks of “hepato-myo-encephopathy” of unknown cause among children occurred yearly in Uttar Pradesh, India typically between September and November. Investigation eventually identified Cassia occidentalis ingestion as the probable cause, typically occurring in children who eat the leaves or pods of the common flowering weed. While Cassia occidentalis has also been used to prepare tea, the amount ingested was minimal. In children, and rarely in adults, the presentation was precipitous with nausea, vomiting, tremor, abnormal and violent behavior, grimacing and self-mutilation followed by stupor and coma at which time serum aminotransferase and bilirubin levels were typically elevated. In severe instances, the liver injury was progressive, serum ammonia and INR levels rose and patients developed coma, convulsions and status epilepticus that was unresponsive to therapy. Autopsies revealed hepatic necrosis and cholestasis. A similar pattern of symptoms and injury occurs in animals that consume Cassia occidentalis. Whether this syndrome has a similar pathogenesis to the rare instance of hepatic injury attributed to typical senna (Cassia acutifolia or angustifolio) that is used as a laxative is unknown.","Wiki_Tox":"N/A"},{"W":"N/A","ID":"HD0045","HDS_Name":"Lesser celandine","Latin_name":"N/A","Sources":"Other","Type":"Herbal","Other_common_names":"N/A","Chinese_Name":"N/A","Chinese":"N/A","Botanical_name":"Ficaria verna L.","Anatomical part of the plant":"leaf","Human_use":"Circulatory disorders","Hepatotoxicity":"YES","Evidence_level":"Level 4","EMA_Link":"N/A","Wiki_Link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficaria_verna","NIH_MedlinePlus":"N/A","TRC_Link":"https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/databases/food,-herbs-supplements/professional.aspx?productid=546","LiverTox_Link":"N/A","LiverTox_Likelyhood":"N/A","LiverTox_hepatotoxicity":"N/A","Wiki_Tox":"N/A"},{"W":"N/A","ID":"HD0049","HDS_Name":"Noni juice","Latin_name":"N/A","Sources":"MedlinePlus,LiverTox","Type":"Herbal","Other_common_names":"noni, morinda, Indian mulberry, hog apple, canarywood","Chinese_Name":"N/A","Chinese":"N/A","Botanical_name":"Morinda citrifolia L.","Anatomical part of the plant":"fruit","Human_use":"Miscellaneous","Hepatotoxicity":"YES","Evidence_level":"Level 4","EMA_Link":"N/A","Wiki_Link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morinda_citrifolia","NIH_MedlinePlus":"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-all/Noni","TRC_Link":"https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/databases/food,-herbs-supplements/professional.aspx?productid=758","LiverTox_Link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548374/","LiverTox_Likelyhood":"C (probable rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury)","LiverTox_hepatotoxicity":"Several case reports have suggested that noni may account for some cases of idiosyncratic acute liver injury, although the association was weak in many cases.

Nevertheless, case series and a systematic review by the United States Pharmacopeia have raised the issue of the potential for GTE to cause hepatotoxicity. In a large prospective study of GTE in postmenopausal woman at risk for breast cancer, GTE was associated with ALT elevations in 6.7% of patients compared to 0.7% of controls. In these studies, clinically apparent liver injury was not observed, but the extract was quickly discontinued in patients with ALT elevations. Restarting GTE in a proportion of patients was followed by rapid recurrence of ALT elevations that resolved again with stopping. The prevalence of green tea extract induced acute liver injury with symptoms or jaundice is not known, but is undoubtedly low in comparison to the wide scale use of these products. Nevertheless, more than 100 instances of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to GTE have been reported in the literature.

Studies of its use in various clinical conditions have found low rates of transient and asymptomatic serum enzyme elevations during therapy but without instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury. Indeed, turmeric has been evaluated as therapy of acute and chronic liver injury, although its efficacy and safety in this situation have not been proven. Recently, isolated case reports of liver injury arising during use of tumeric dietary supplements have been published. At issue is whether there were other exposures that might have accounted for the injury or whether contaminants might have been the cause rather than tumeric itself. One reason for its safety and lack of hepatotoxicity is that curcumin is poorly absorbed by the oral route, and it is unclear whether there is adequate systemic exposure to achieve any of the purported effects of turmeric or curcumin. Nevertheless, tumeric may be a rare cause of idiosyncratic liver injury and deserves further scrutiny for its safety and efficacy when given in relative large doses over an extended period","Wiki_Tox":"N/A"},{"W":"N/A","ID":"HD0011","HDS_Name":"Butterbur","Latin_name":"N/A","Sources":"MedlinePlus","Type":"Herbal","Other_common_names":"butterbur, petasites, purple butterbur","Chinese_Name":"N/A","Chinese":"蜂斗菜属","Botanical_name":"Petasites hybridus, Petasites officinalis, Tussilago hybrida","Anatomical part of the plant":"root, rhizome, leaf","Human_use":"Urinary tract and genital disorders","Hepatotoxicity":"YES","Evidence_level":"Level 2","EMA_Link":"N/A","Wiki_Link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petasites","NIH_MedlinePlus":"https://nccih.nih.gov/health/butterbur","TRC_Link":"https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/databases/food,-herbs-supplements/professional.aspx?productid=649","LiverTox_Link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547997/","LiverTox_Likelyhood":"C (probable cause of clinically apparent liver injury, possibly caused by contaminants)","LiverTox_hepatotoxicity":"Despite widespread use, butterbur extracts that are free of pyrrolizidine alkaloids have not been specifically linked to liver injury, either in the form of transient serum enzyme elevations or clinically apparent acute liver injury. However, because the processing of butterbur is critical to the safety of the herbal product, it has to be used with caution. After the European approval of a commercial butterbur product for use in migraine headache prevention, isolated reports of cholestatic hepatitis arose. Testing suggested that some preparations contained detectable amounts of pyrrolizidine alkaloids and some of the products were withdrawn. The relationship of the liver injury to butterbur remains controversial. A single publication summarizing clinical features of 10 cases reported to the sponsor has suggested that the liver injury was not related to the butterbur product, but 8 of the 10 cases were reasonably convincing and described a consistent clinical phenotype of fatigue, nausea and jaundice usually arising within 2 to 12 weeks of starting the product and marked by a hepatocellular pattern of injury and moderate-to-severe jaundice. Two cases resulted in urgent liver transplants, while the others apparently recovered, usually within 2 to 12 weeks. The clinical features of cases did not resemble sinusoidal obstruction syndrome and liver biopsy showed an acute hepatitis with variable degrees of cholestasis, but minimal steatosis or fibrosis and no mention of sinusoidal obstruction.

(probable cause of clinically apparent liver injury)","LiverTox_hepatotoxicity":"Several cases of clinically apparent acute liver injury have been attributed to commercial dietary supplements that contain usnic acid. “LipoKinetix” was one such supplement advertised as a weight loss and body building supplement. Each tablet contained sodium usniate (100 mg), norephedrine (25 mg), diiodothyronine (100 mg), yohimbine (3 mg) and caffeine (100 mg). The product has been linked to multiple instances of acute liver injury. The time to onset was 2 to 12 weeks and the clinical presentation resembled acute viral hepatitis with onset of fatigue and nausea, followed by jaundice. The pattern of serum enzyme elevations was hepatocellular, with marked elevations in serum ALT and minimal increases in alkaline phosphatase levels. Liver biopsy demonstrated acute hepatocellular necrosis and inflammation. Immunoallergic features (fever, rash and eosinophilia) were not common and autoantibodies were usually not present. Recovery was rapid with stopping the dietary supplement, but some cases were severe and led to acute liver failure and either death or need for emergency liver transplantation. Instances of acute hepatitis have also been reported with other multi-ingredient dietary supplements that contain usnic acid, but much more rarely than with LipoKinetix which was withdrawn from distribution after a FDA warning letter. Rare instances of hepatotoxicity have also been reported with use of lichen based teas known as Kombucha tea, but whether these were due to usnic acid or another contaminant of the tea was not shown","Wiki_Tox":"N/A"},{"W":"N/A","ID":"HD0204","HDS_Name":"Mastic tree resin","Latin_name":"Pistacia lentiscus, resinum (mastix)","Sources":"EMA","Type":"Herbal","Other_common_names":"Mastic tree resin","Chinese_Name":"N/A","Chinese":"乳香脂","Botanical_name":"Pistacia lentiscus L.","Anatomical part of the plant":"N/A","Human_use":"Gastrointestinal disorders","Hepatotoxicity":"No","Evidence_level":"Level 0","EMA_Link":"https://www.ema.europa.eu/medicines/herbal/pistacia-lentiscus-resinum-mastix","Wiki_Link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastic_(plant_resin)","NIH_MedlinePlus":"N/A","TRC_Link":"https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/databases/food,-herbs-supplements/professional.aspx?productid=565","LiverTox_Link":"N/A","LiverTox_Likelyhood":"N/A","LiverTox_hepatotoxicity":"N/A","Wiki_Tox":"N/A"},{"W":"N/A","ID":"HD0205","HDS_Name":"Meadowsweet","Latin_name":"Filipendulae ulmariae flos, Filipendulae ulmariae herba","Sources":"EMA","Type":"Herbal","Other_common_names":"Meadowsweet Flower","Chinese_Name":"N/A","Chinese":"旋果蚊子草","Botanical_name":"Filipendula ulmaria (L.)

In clinical trials, there have been no reports of serum enzyme elevations occurring during therapy and no mention of serious adverse events or hepatotoxicity. Recently, however, several cases of clinically apparent liver injury have been reported in patients taking commercial herbal products that are labelled as containing ashwagandha. The liver injury presented 2 to 12 weeks after starting ashwagandha with a cholestatic or mixed pattern of injury, jaundice and pruritus. Immunoallergic and autoimmune features were not prominent. Jaundice tended to be protracted but ultimately resolved without fatalities or chronic injury. Because commercial herbal preparations are often mixtures of herbs and nutritional products and can be mislabeled and contain unknown herbs and medications, it is not always clear whether the reported cases were due to ashwagandha and one of its components or to a contaminant. In several reported cases, however, the commercial product being taken was tested and found to have ashwagandha without other contaminants. Thus, clinically apparent liver injury attributable to ashwagandha appears to occur, but is rare.","Wiki_Tox":"N/A"},{"W":"N/A","ID":"HD0229","HDS_Name":"Peony","Latin_name":"Paeoniae radix alba, Paeoniae radix rubra","Sources":"EMA","Type":"Herbal","Other_common_names":"Peony root","Chinese_Name":"Shao Yao","Chinese":"芍药","Botanical_name":"Paeonia lactiflora Pallas","Anatomical part of the plant":"root","Human_use":"Pain and inflammation","Hepatotoxicity":"No","Evidence_level":"Level 0","EMA_Link":"from EMA","Wiki_Link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peony","NIH_MedlinePlus":"N/A","TRC_Link":"https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/databases/food,-herbs-supplements/professional.aspx?productid=32","LiverTox_Link":"N/A","LiverTox_Likelyhood":"N/A","LiverTox_hepatotoxicity":"N/A","Wiki_Tox":"N/A"},{"W":"N/A","ID":"HD0230","HDS_Name":"Peppermint","Latin_name":"Menthae piperitae folium, Menthae piperitae aetheroleum","Sources":"EMA,MedlinePlus","Type":"Herbal","Other_common_names":"peppermint, peppermint oil, Peppermint leaf","Chinese_Name":"N/A","Chinese":"辣薄荷","Botanical_name":"Mentha x piperita L.","Anatomical part of the plant":"leaf","Human_use":"Pain and inflammation,Skin disorders & minor wounds,Cough and cold,Gastrointestinal disorders","Hepatotoxicity":"No","Evidence_level":"Level 0","EMA_Link":"from EMA","Wiki_Link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppermint","NIH_MedlinePlus":"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-all/PeppermintOil","TRC_Link":"https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/databases/food,-herbs-supplements/professional.aspx?productid=705","LiverTox_Link":"N/A","LiverTox_Likelyhood":"N/A","LiverTox_hepatotoxicity":"N/A","Wiki_Tox":"N/A"},{"W":"N/A","ID":"HD0231","HDS_Name":"Peru balsam","Latin_name":"Balsamum peruvianum","Sources":"EMA","Type":"Herbal","Other_common_names":"Peru balsam","Chinese_Name":"N/A","Chinese":"N/A","Botanical_name":"Myroxylon balsamum (L.)
