Outbreaks of “hepato-myo-encephopathy” of unknown cause among children occurred yearly in Uttar Pradesh, India typically between September and November. Investigation eventually identified Cassia occidentalis ingestion as the probable cause, typically occurring in children who eat the leaves or pods of the common flowering weed. While Cassia occidentalis has also been used to prepare tea, the amount ingested was minimal. In children, and rarely in adults, the presentation was precipitous with nausea, vomiting, tremor, abnormal and violent behavior, grimacing and self-mutilation followed by stupor and coma at which time serum aminotransferase and bilirubin levels were typically elevated. In severe instances, the liver injury was progressive, serum ammonia and INR levels rose and patients developed coma, convulsions and status epilepticus that was unresponsive to therapy. Autopsies revealed hepatic necrosis and cholestasis. A similar pattern of symptoms and injury occurs in animals that consume Cassia occidentalis.

The onset of acute injury varied from 2 to 18 weeks (averaging 9 weeks) after starting germander capsules or tea. The typical presentation was with fatigue, nausea and jaundice in an acute viral hepatitis-like syndrome with a hepatocellular pattern of serum enzyme elevations. Immunoallergic features were uncommon or minimal as were autoantibodies. Liver biopsies showed a prominence of centrilobular necrosis and inflammation with minimal fibrosis. Most patients recovered rapidly upon withdrawal of germander, but a few fatalities were reported. Rapid recurrence with reexposure was reported on multiple occasions. A second pattern of injury was identified with longer term therapy, generally after 6 to 9 months of treatment, characterized by a chronic hepatitis-like syndrome often with arthralgias and fever and low levels of autoantibodies and hyperglobulinemia, with liver biopsy showing chronic hepatitis and fibrosis. Germander was banned in several European countries and was never marketed to a major extent in the United States. Other species of Teucrium (polium, capitatum, viscidum) have been implicated in causing similar hepatocellular injury clinically and histologically. Germander has been reported to be an adulterant of other herbal preparations including skullcap. Finally, germander has been implicated in liver injury, even when used to brew herbal teas.

Nevertheless, case series and a systematic review by the United States Pharmacopeia have raised the issue of the potential for GTE to cause hepatotoxicity. In a large prospective study of GTE in postmenopausal woman at risk for breast cancer, GTE was associated with ALT elevations in 6.7% of patients compared to 0.7% of controls. In these studies, clinically apparent liver injury was not observed, but the extract was quickly discontinued in patients with ALT elevations. Restarting GTE in a proportion of patients was followed by rapid recurrence of ALT elevations that resolved again with stopping. The prevalence of green tea extract induced acute liver injury with symptoms or jaundice is not known, but is undoubtedly low in comparison to the wide scale use of these products. Nevertheless, more than 100 instances of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to GTE have been reported in the literature. Liver injury typically arises within 1 to 6 months of starting the product but longer and shorter latencies (particularly with reexposure) have been reported. The majority of cases present with an acute hepatitis-like syndrome and a markedly hepatocellular pattern of serum enzyme elevations. Most patients recover rapidly upon stopping the extract or HDS, although fatal instances of acute liver failure have been described. Biopsy findings show necrosis, inflammation, and eosinophils in a pattern resembling acute hepatitis. Immunoallergic and autoimmune features are usually absent or minimal. A small number of similar cases have also been described after drinking green tea “infusions” rather than taking oral preparations of extracts of green tea. The most prominent regulatory action against green tea containing products concerned Exolise, a weight loss product which was withdrawn from Spain and France in 2003. Also, green tea is an ingredient in many over-the-counter weight loss agents with names such as Hydroxycut, Dexatrim, Slimquick, Slimcut Fat Burner, The Right Approach, Mega Green Tea and Green Tea Fat Burner, among others, which have been implicated in causing rare instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury."},{"A":"HD0051","B":"Polygonum multiflorum","C":"Radix Polygoni Multiflori","D":"LiverTox","E":"Herbal","F":"Fo Ti","G":"He Shou Wu","H":"何首乌","I":"Polygonum multiflorum Thunb.","J":"root","K":"Miscellaneous","L":"YES","M":"Level 4","O":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallopia_multiflora","P":"N/A","Q":"N/A","R":"https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/databases/food,-herbs-supplements/professional.aspx?productid=768","S":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548795/","T":"A (well established cause of clinically apparent liver injury)","U":"Several published cases and a large case series from China, Korea and Japan of clinically apparent acute liver injury have been attributed to use of Polygonum multiflorum.

Recently, isolated case reports of liver injury arising during use of tumeric dietary supplements have been published. At issue is whether there were other exposures that might have accounted for the injury or whether contaminants might have been the cause rather than tumeric itself. One reason for its safety and lack of hepatotoxicity is that curcumin is poorly absorbed by the oral route, and it is unclear whether there is adequate systemic exposure to achieve any of the purported effects of turmeric or curcumin.

elevations above 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in only 1% to 2% of recipients. Since its release, however, there have been several reports of clinically apparent acute liver injury attributed to flavocoxid. Most cases have occurred in women, who perhaps are more likely to use flavocoxid. The time to onset was 1 to 5 months, and the pattern of enzyme elevations was usually hepatocellular or mixed. Most cases were moderate in severity and no instance of acute liver failure or death has been reported. Resolution upon stopping flavocoxid occurred in 1 to 3 months. Immunoallergic features were present in some patients, but were mild and autoantibodies were not common. At least one instance of recurrence upon rechallenge has been reported."},{"A":"HD0047","B":"Mao Guo Tian Jie Cai","D":"Other","E":"Herbal","G":"Mao Guo Tian Jie Cai","H":"毛果天芥菜","I":"Heliotropium lasiocarpum Fisch. & C.

Each tablet contained sodium usniate (100 mg), norephedrine (25 mg), diiodothyronine (100 mg), yohimbine (3 mg) and caffeine (100 mg). The product has been linked to multiple instances of acute liver injury. The time to onset was 2 to 12 weeks and the clinical presentation resembled acute viral hepatitis with onset of fatigue and nausea, followed by jaundice. The pattern of serum enzyme elevations was hepatocellular, with marked elevations in serum ALT and minimal increases in alkaline phosphatase levels. Liver biopsy demonstrated acute hepatocellular necrosis and inflammation. Immunoallergic features (fever, rash and eosinophilia) were not common and autoantibodies were usually not present. Recovery was rapid with stopping the dietary supplement, but some cases were severe and led to acute liver failure and either death or need for emergency liver transplantation. Instances of acute hepatitis have also been reported with other multi-ingredient dietary supplements that contain usnic acid, but much more rarely than with LipoKinetix which was withdrawn from distribution after a FDA warning letter. Rare instances of hepatotoxicity have also been reported with use of lichen based teas known as Kombucha tea, but whether these were due to usnic acid or another contaminant of the tea was not shown"},{"A":"HD0204","B":"Mastic tree resin","C":"Pistacia lentiscus, resinum (mastix)","D":"EMA","E":"Herbal","F":"Mastic tree resin","H":"乳香脂","I":"Pistacia lentiscus L.","K":"Gastrointestinal disorders","L":"No","M":"Level 0","N":"https://www.ema.europa.eu/medicines/herbal/pistacia-lentiscus-resinum-mastix","O":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastic_(plant_resin)","R":"https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/databases/food,-herbs-supplements/professional.aspx?productid=565","U":"N/A"},{"A":"HD0205","B":"Meadowsweet","C":"Filipendulae ulmariae flos, Filipendulae ulmariae herba","D":"EMA","E":"Herbal","F":"Meadowsweet Flower","H":"旋果蚊子草","I":"Filipendula ulmaria (L.)

(probable cause of clinically apparent liver injury)","U":"Despite widescale use, ashwagandha is considered generally safe and without major adverse effects. In clinical trials, there have been no reports of serum enzyme elevations occurring during therapy and no mention of serious adverse events or hepatotoxicity. Recently, however, several cases of clinically apparent liver injury have been reported in patients taking commercial herbal products that are labelled as containing ashwagandha. The liver injury presented 2 to 12 weeks after starting ashwagandha with a cholestatic or mixed pattern of injury, jaundice and pruritus. Immunoallergic and autoimmune features were not prominent. Jaundice tended to be protracted but ultimately resolved without fatalities or chronic injury. Because commercial herbal preparations are often mixtures of herbs and nutritional products and can be mislabeled and contain unknown herbs and medications, it is not always clear whether the reported cases were due to ashwagandha and one of its components or to a contaminant. In several reported cases, however, the commercial product being taken was tested and found to have ashwagandha without other contaminants. Thus, clinically apparent liver injury attributable to ashwagandha appears to occur, but is rare."},{"A":"HD0229","B":"Peony","C":"Paeoniae radix alba, Paeoniae radix rubra","D":"EMA","E":"Herbal","F":"Peony root","G":"Shao Yao","H":"芍药","I":"Paeonia lactiflora Pallas","J":"root","K":"Pain and inflammation","L":"No","M":"Level 0","N":"from EMA","O":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peony","R":"https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/databases/food,-herbs-supplements/professional.aspx?productid=32","U":"N/A"},{"A":"HD0230","B":"Peppermint","C":"Menthae piperitae folium, Menthae piperitae aetheroleum","D":"EMA,MedlinePlus","E":"Herbal","F":"peppermint, peppermint oil, Peppermint leaf","H":"辣薄荷","I":"Mentha x piperita L.","J":"leaf","K":"Pain and inflammation,Skin disorders & minor wounds,Cough and cold,Gastrointestinal disorders","L":"No","M":"Level 0","N":"from EMA","O":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppermint","P":"https://nccih.nih.gov/health/peppermintoil","Q":"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-all/PeppermintOil","R":"https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/databases/food,-herbs-supplements/professional.aspx?productid=705","U":"N/A"},{"A":"HD0231","B":"Peru balsam","C":"Balsamum peruvianum","D":"EMA","E":"Herbal","F":"Peru balsam","I":"Myroxylon balsamum (L.)
