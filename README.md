# fda-web-app

Web application created during my internship with the FDA. Used NodeJS for the backend, Express Handlebars for the middleware/frontend, and Fly.io to deploy the website from GitHub. Currently available to the public at [http](https://hdstox.fly.dev/)

## Running the app locally

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/rdkhare/fda-web-app.git`

2. Open the folder where the repository is located. Install NodeJS, if you do not have it already, and run the command `npm install` to install the packages required to run the application.

3. Run the command `npm start` to start the app.
   
4. Open the app at [HTTP]localhost:3000/
